Robotnic is an open source robotics prorgramming shell for education built on JohnnyFive and Google Blockly. By dragging and assembling blocks together in the right sequence, you can make your robot do cool things and switch to a source code view for more advanced hacking!

This is being developed for a workshop for Makerland Conference. If I was smarter, I would have probably used [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), but how could I turn down the opportunity to write an awesome new piece of software?
